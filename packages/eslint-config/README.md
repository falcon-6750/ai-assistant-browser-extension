# ESLint Config

Shared ESLint configuration generated by [TurboRepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) when this project was initialized with `npx create-turbo@latest`. The `NextJS` config was removed because it was not needed.

## Example Usage

This configuration can be used in any other package or app in this repo to configure ESLint.

Within this repo, add this package as a dependency to another package or app by updating its `package.json` file.

```json
{
  "name": "some-other-package", // another package in this repo
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@repo/eslint-config": "*" // import this config package
    // Do not import eslint. It's a transient dependency from @repo/eslint-config
  }
}
```

Create an `eslint.config.js` file in another app or package in this repo and then reference one of the config files in this package.

```js
import { config } from "@repo/eslint-config/react-internal";

/** @type {import("eslint").Linter.Config} */
export default config;
```
