# TypeScript Config

Shared TypeScript configuration generated by [TurboRepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) when this project was initialized with `npx create-turbo@latest`. The `NextJS` config was removed because it was not needed.

## Example Usage

This configuration can be used in any other package or app in this repo to configure TypeScript. 

Within this repo, add this package as a dependency to another package or app by updating its `package.json` file.

```json
{
  "name": "some-other-package", // another package in this repo
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@repo/typescript-config": "*", // import this config package
    "typescript": "5.5.4"           // required to use typescript
  }
}
```

Create a `tsconfig.json` file in another app or package in this repo and then reference one of the config files in this package.

```json
{
  "extends": "@repo/typescript-config/react-library.json"
  // further extend tsconfig.json as necessary
}
```
